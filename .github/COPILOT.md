# Issue Templates & Copilot Configuration

## Copilot Coding Agent

This repository uses GitHub Copilot to automatically work on issues.

### How it works:

1. **Create an issue** describing a bug or feature request
2. **Add the `copilot` label** (or `bug` / `good first issue`)
3. **Copilot analyzes** the issue and codebase
4. **A PR is created** with the proposed fix

### Labels that trigger Copilot:

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `copilot` | Explicitly request Copilot to work on this |
| `bug` | Bug reports - Copilot will attempt a fix |
| `good first issue` | Simple issues suitable for automation |

### Tips for good Copilot issues:

- Be specific about the problem
- Include error messages or logs
- Reference specific files if known
- Describe expected vs actual behavior

### Manual Assignment

You can also manually assign Copilot to any issue by:
1. Going to the issue
2. Clicking "Assignees"
3. Selecting "copilot"
